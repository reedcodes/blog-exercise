# blog-exercise

As part of a coding exercise, I created this blog using 11ty, Nunjucks, Sass, and other tools to showcase a functional website using a lot of sample content. The goal now is to put this repository in development again, and offer it up as an 11ty starter or sample site. Comments and issues are welcome!
